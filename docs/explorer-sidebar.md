# Explorer sidebar and side pane

The Explorer sidebar and the side pane share panel implementations, but they have different shell
contracts.

| Surface          | Purpose                      | Lifecycle                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Explorer sidebar | Files and Changes navigation | Cmd+E shows or hides the dedicated dock    |
| Side pane        | Ordinary workspace content   | Created and closed like any workspace pane |

## Panel host contract

Every desktop panel registers its supported `PaneHost` values and presentation. Launchers derive
fixed-target labels and icons from that registration, filter by host, and never substitute one
panel type for another. Tab moves reject unsupported destinations, and placement resolves only to
a compatible pane.

Files and Changes are the Explorer defaults and its singleton navigation views. Other compatible
tabs, including agents, terminals, files, and diffs, can move between Explorer and main panes.
Keep panel implementations independent of either shell. `WorkspacePanelHost` owns mounting and
retention, while each shell owns its tabs, focus, dragging, resizing, and shortcuts.

## Explorer sidebar

`packages/app/src/workspace-tabs/explorer-sidebar.ts` owns show, hide, toggle, and view selection.
On desktop, the shell is rendered outside the workspace split canvas so it divides the full
workspace, including the header. It has its own persisted width and resize handle. Main-pane splits
never read or modify that width.

`packages/app/src/workspace-tabs/open-supporting-view.ts` owns semantic Changes and pull-request
opens. Compact and wide native layouts select the matching Explorer tab. Desktop Changes opens
follow the shared diff preference. Desktop pull requests use their Main panel, On the side, or
Explorer sidebar setting. Automatic PR discovery follows that preference once per workspace without
interrupting the user's work. Closing the tab opts that workspace out of future automatic opens,
even for a different PR; moving or reordering it remains the user's choice.
Callers request the content and never choose the shell.
The composer Changes pill is a two-stage desktop action: it first reveals Explorer on Changes, then
routes later presses to the working diff through the shared diff preference.

The persisted layout still contains the Explorer pane so tabs survive reloads. The renderer removes
that pane from the workspace split tree and docks it separately. Persisted identifiers retain the
literal `"explorer"` pane id and `explorerPaneIdByWorkspace` key for compatibility.

The tab rail has no inline add or close controls. Its context menu opens a New Tab launcher and
toggles Files, Changes, and Explorer-compatible workspace-scoped plugin panels from the shared
launch catalog. Individual tab menus close instances or move compatible tabs to main. Explorer tabs
can be reordered, but the dock cannot be split. Selecting an Explorer tab does not change workspace
focus.

Cmd+E shows or hides Explorer without changing its selected view. Compact layouts use the combined
full-screen Explorer overlay for Changes, Files, and pull requests, and close it after a file opens. Compact Changes has no tree rail; its overview is the Jump to file action (`packages/app/src/git/jump-to-file/`), a sheet over the same changed-files tree the desktop rail renders.
Wide native layouts without pane splits use the same combined content in a resizable inline dock;
opening a file leaves that dock visible. Both presentations keep their selection in the panel store
and reuse the layout store's per-workspace Explorer width. They do not create a second Explorer
lifecycle.

## Side pane

`packages/app/src/workspace-tabs/open-beside.ts` owns content opened beside the user's work. The
layout store remembers one ordinary pane per workspace. The first side open creates a full-height
right split around the workspace root; later side opens reuse it.

Removing a pane clears its remembered id; a later side open creates a new pane. The last visible
ordinary pane stays when its final tab closes and shows the New launcher. An empty workspace does
not automatically create an agent draft tab; choosing Agent opens one. Explorer cannot replace the
workspace canvas, even when visible. Restoring a saved layout enforces the same rule while preserving Explorer and saved
tab content. There is no hidden side-pane lifecycle.

Placement intent still controls existing tabs:

| Mode      | New target                  | Existing target                   |
| --------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `pane`    | opens in the requested pane | moves to the requested pane       |
| `prefer`  | opens in the requested pane | stays where the user placed it    |
| `focused` | opens in the focused pane   | focuses it where it already lives |
| `ambient` | opens in a compatible pane  | focuses it where it already lives |

Explicit **Open to Side** uses `pane`. Implicit opens use `prefer`, so a preference affects only a
new target and never yanks an existing tab out of a user-selected pane.

## Linked resources

Resolve file links on the agent's daemon. Directory links open through the same file tab as files,
because only the daemon knows the resource kind. When the file pane learns the path is a directory
inside the workspace, it hands the path to the Explorer sidebar and closes itself: the Files tree
expands the ancestors, selects the directory and scrolls to it (`packages/app/src/file-explorer/reveal-request.ts`).
Compare both the requested and the canonical path against the workspace root; the daemon reports
canonical paths, so a symlinked root such as `/home` → `/var/home` would otherwise look external.

A directory outside the workspace stays in the tab as a Files view rooted at that directory; its
navigation state stays separate from the workspace Explorer. Child file opens keep absolute host
paths so a link outside the workspace cannot resolve against the wrong root.

Preview requests carry a size budget. The daemon returns metadata for directories, oversized files,
and unsupported types before transferring contents. Keep download, copy-path, and containing-folder
actions available when a preview cannot be rendered. System editor and file-manager actions require
a local daemon; never send a remote host path to the client's desktop bridge.

HTTP(S) links follow the chat-link preference below. Other supported URL schemes go through an
explicit system-application handoff with a copy-address action. Unknown schemes and remote-authority
`file://host/path` links remain copyable; they must not be treated as local paths.

## Routing preferences

Desktop **Settings → Layout → Open location** has independent Main panel or On the side choices for
Explorer Files, diffs, chat files, files opened from diffs, subagents, and terminals. They default to Main
panel. Mobile ignores them. Terminal creation, script terminal opens, and plugin terminal navigation
share this preference. Explicit pane placement wins; revealing an existing terminal keeps its pane.

Chat URLs independently choose Ask, Internal browser — side, Internal browser — tab, or External
browser. Ask offers the internal tab and external browser for that click. Script service URLs keep
their separate Ask, In Paseo, or External browser behavior.

Pull requests have a three-way open location: Main panel, On the side, or Explorer sidebar. Explorer
sidebar is the default. Compact layouts always open pull requests in Explorer regardless of this
desktop preference.

Panels request an implicit open through the narrow `openPreferredTarget(target, source)` pane
contract. Entry points outside panels use `openPreferredWorkspaceTarget`. Do not branch on a
specific shell inside a panel.
